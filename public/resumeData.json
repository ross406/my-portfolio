        "text": "It is with much pleasure that I take this opportunity to write a personal recommendation for Roshan Sharma. He has been a crucial member of the web development team of Broadway Society and was working as a Full Stack Developer since he joined us on 04th April 2020 till 04th July 2020.      His task was to design and build our website - www.broadwaysociety.in , which he successfully did, and the organisation is really proud of him. Over his term of 100+ days at the organisation he has had diverse responsibilities, as a web developer. Being a Web Developer can be irritating at times, but for Roshan, it is something he loves, and puts all his time, effort and energy into. He worked both on the Front End and the Back End of the website. He has been regularly up to date with all the tasks assigned to him and has continuously provided the organisation with extremely high-quality work. Roshan carries his duties with due diligence and enthusiasm thus giving out his best. He is very focused and eyeing to make a name for himself in this field. He is an outgoing student of good character and a team builder. I have found him to be an individual of great commitment and focus, duly possessing exceptional logical thinking skills as manifested in his performance towards the duties and responsibilities. He is a dedicated individual and works with extreme professionalism. I can therefore recommend him to any place that he wants to go for. With my knowledge, I know he has the necessary skills and expertise to perform the duties assigned to him timely. I am confident he will apply the same enthusiasm in any institution where he is a part of. Having Roshan in your institution is more of an asset.",
